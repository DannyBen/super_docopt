  # This is an array, where each item can:
  #   - a string that represents both the name of the subcommand in your
  #     CLI application and the method name
  #   - a hash with one key => value, where the key is the subcommand in
  #     your CLI application, and the value is the method name.
  #     This feature was designed to allow having commands that may be 
  #     reserved names in Ruby (e.g. `initialize`).
  #
  # Commands with '-' will use '_' when looking for a method name 
  # (e.g. the command 'start-server' will need a 'start_server' method).

  # Optional:
  # Implement `before_execute` with any logic.
  # You have access to all the supplied arguments through the `args`
  # instance variable.

  # Implement `after_execute` with any logic.
  # You have access to all the supplied arguments through the `args`
  # instance variable.

  # Subcommand Implementation
  # Each subcommand should have a method implementation.
  # You can use the `args` instance variable to access all the arguments
  # that were supplied by the command line.
